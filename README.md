# 🛠️ BRASSBOUND MODPACK

**Welcome to the Brassbound Modpack Repository!**  
This repo contains all the updates and additions for the Brassbound Minecraft Server. If you’re here, congrats — you’re one of the special folks invited to play!

## 🌍 What is Brassbound?

Brassbound is a custom Minecraft SMP built around the **Create Mod**, plus a variety of other quality-of-life and content-enhancing mods. While Season 1 doesn’t use a self-updating CurseForge pack (my bad 😅), we’ve got a simple update process to keep everyone synced with the server.

## 📦 How to Install / Update Mods

### ✅ Step 1: Get the Base Modpack

Make sure you've already redeemed the code and installed the Brassbound Modpack from CurseForge. This gives you a working base to build from.
