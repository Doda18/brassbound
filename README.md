The Brassbound mods for the Minecraft Server. If you're here then you're one of the special people who was invited to play!

Welcome! I'm glad you're looking forward to joining Brassbound, the SMP for the Create Mod plus tons other. This is going to be a brief little walkthrough on how to setup and replace the CurseForge Modpack to update with the server. Unfortunately this being my first time running a server, I should've created the modpack myself so it could've auto-updated but we're going to aim for that in season 2.

First thing is first, make sure you've gotten the code to the profile that way we already have a base installation for you. Once that's done, go ahead and hover over the "Brassbound Modpack" and click on it. This should open a description about the modpack.

Now simply click on the three dots and select "Open Folder"

Now download whatever update that's currently released and add the files into your mods folder. Simply just drag and drop the .jar files in and start your game!
